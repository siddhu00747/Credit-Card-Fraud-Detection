💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
📌 Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraudulent cases are highly rare (<1% of total), making this a classic imbalanced classification problem. The project applies preprocessing, resampling, and ML models to improve fraud detection performance.

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection

Records: 284,807 transactions

Features:

V1–V28 → anonymized PCA features

Time → seconds from first transaction

Amount → transaction amount

Class → target (0 = genuine, 1 = fraud)
